# baseball-podcasts
Baseball season is coming! Here's a podcast audio streamer for Major League Baseball so you stay up to date with the latest news, stats, opinions, etc. The podcasts can be streamed directly through the browser of your mobile device or computer.

##Description
What does it do? Baseball Podcasts will play your favorite baseball podcasts - plain and simple.

##What I'm working with
1. React
2. Redux
3. Node
4. [Audio Player][]
5. iTunes API
2. Mobile UI

##Getting Started
####Before Getting Started, install Node on your machine
1. Clone the repo from your Github account to your machine. 
2. CD into baseball-podcasts directory and run the following commands:
  - npm install (installs all of the dependencies needed)
  - npm run build (to build webpack and watch for changes)
  - npm run start (runs nodemon. You can npm i -g nodemon or change the script to node)

##Roadmap
v1.0 Build a mobile first design, set up Redux store to manage state, add audio player, fetch podcasts and it's playlists from iTunes API, enable ability to switch podcasts, deploy to Heroku.
